# Rules
Developed in the realm of the [NIE-INE](http://www.fee.unibas.ch/nie_ine.html) project.  
For different scientific edition projects in the Humanities at the Basel University a series of extra- and interdependent vocabularies or [ontologies]() are created, to express data and metadata in a formal machine-readable way.  
Formal here means adhering to the [model theory of W3C RDF, RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/), and [OWL Full](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/).
The ontologies are declared in [Turtle syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).  
Besides these ontologies [Notation 3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) (N3) rule sets, expressed using elements of NIE and other ontologies, are developed for different purposes, e.g. consistency checking.  
Notation 3 is an assertion and logic language which is a superset of RDF. N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, logical implication, and functional predicates, as well as providing an textual syntax (alternative to RDF/XML). In this way Turtle is a subset of N3 syntax.
