# Rules
Developed in the realm of the [NIE-INE](http://www.fee.unibas.ch/nie_ine.html) project.  
For different scientific edition projects in the Humanities at the Basel University a series of extra- and interdependent vocabularies or [ontologies]() are created, to express data and metadata in a formal machine-readable way.  
Formal here means adhering to the [model theory of W3C RDF, RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/), and [OWL Full](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/).
The ontologies are declared in [Turtle syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).  
Besides these ontologies [Notation 3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) (N3) rules, expressed also using elements of NIE and other ontologies, are developed for different purposes, e.g. consistency checking.  These rules are to be used with a machine reasoner.  
Notation 3 is an assertion and logic language which is a superset of RDF. N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, logical implication, and functional predicates, as well as providing a textual syntax (alternative to RDF/XML). In this way Turtle is a subset of N3 syntax.  
An introduction to [Semantic Web technology](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies/wiki/Introduction-to-Semantic-Web-technology) is on the Ontologies wiki.
