# N3-rules for machine reasoning
In the [NIE-INE](http://www.nie-ine.ch)-project we develop an infrastructure to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles, and ensuring long-term storage of the data.  
The project runs at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, ZÃ¼rich, and Geneva until end of 2020.

The essence of the infrastructure is that data, stored in e.g. a MySQL relational database, are converted to a different machine-readable format, i.e. one that makes the semantics of the data explicit.  
To enable data expression in this new format a series of vocabularies or [ontologies](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies) are created, representing [Semantic Web technology](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies/wiki/1.-Introduction-to-Semantic-Web-technology).  

Besides these ontologies, rules for machine resoning are developed. They are expressed in the [Notation 3 language](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/), also using elements of NIE and other ontologies. 
Notation 3 is an assertion and logic language which is a superset of RDF. N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, logical implication, and functional predicates, as well as providing a textual syntax (alternative to RDF/XML). In this way Turtle is a subset of N3 syntax.  

N3-rules serve different purposes.  

### Implementation of the RDF model theory:
A first one is the [implementation of the RDF model theory](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/rpo). This set of N3-rules permits to infer data from data based on the built-in logic in the W3C Semantic Web standard languages.
Examples: rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:SubPropertyOf, owl:TransitiveProperty, owl:oneOf, owl:unionOf, owl:disjointUnionOf, owl:propertyChainAxiom

### Consistency checking:
User-defined restrictions can be checked upon, e.g. a cardinality restriction for the object value of certain property of a certain subject class instance.

### Temporal reasoning:
Time indicators are uniformly converted to intervals to calculate with. Sets of built-ins and plug-ins in the machine reasoner support several ontologies and the usage of xsd datatyped literals (e.g. xsd:dateTime, xsd:duration).

### Basic command example for EYE:
    eye			  # call the machine reasoner  
    			  # one or more options can be used, e.g.  
    --nope		          # option for output without a proof
    --traditional	          # option for N3 syntax, e.g. @prefix instead of PREFIX  
    			  # data references can be added:  
    .../rdf-data.ttl	  # ref. to one or more RDF data sets expressed in Turtle syntax (.ttl, subset of N3); .ttl can be replaced by .n3  
    .../owl-ontology.ttl      # ref. to one or more OWL ontologies expressed in OWL Full or lesser sublanguage, using all possible elements of RDF/S-OWL ontologies  
    .../rule.n3		  # ref. to one or more N3-rules; EYE is a 'stateless' reasoner, meaning that all inferencing formalisms have to be fed to it  
    		          # output as a pass OR an N3-query:  
    --pass		          # output deductive closure: all the stated and inferred triples except the rules 
    --pass-all		  # output deductive closure plus rules  
    --query		          # output filtered with filter rules  
    >			  # output can be written to a file
    .../result.n3		  # result file
