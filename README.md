# Rules
In the [NIE-INE](http://www.nie-ine.ch)-project we develop an infrastructure to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles, and ensuring long-term storage of the data.  
The project runs at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, ZÃ¼rich, and Geneva until end of 2020.

The essence of the infrastructure is that data, stored in e.g. a MySQL relational database, are converted to a different machine-readable format, i.e. one that makes the semantics of the data explicit.  
To enable data expression in this new format a series of vocabularies or [ontologies](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies) are created, representing [Semantic Web technology](https://github.com/nie-ine/Ontologies/wiki/1.-Introduction-to-Semantic-Web-technology).  

Besides these ontologies, rules for machine resoning are developed. They are expressed in the [Notation 3 language](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/), also using elements of NIE and other ontologies. N3-rules serve different purposes.
A first one is the [implementation of the RDF model theory](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/rpo). This series of N3-rules is published at 

 is consistency checking.  These rules are to be used with a machine reasoner.  
Notation 3 is an assertion and logic language which is a superset of RDF. N3 extends the RDF datamodel by adding formulae (literals which are graphs themselves), variables, logical implication, and functional predicates, as well as providing a textual syntax (alternative to RDF/XML). In this way Turtle is a subset of N3 syntax.  

An introduction to [N3 rules for machine reasoning](https://github.com/nie-ine/Rules/wiki/Introduction-to-N3-rules-for-machine-reasoning) is on the wiki.
