# Rule setting an arbitrary though realistic maximum of a person's life duration.
# To have an idea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_life_span
# Backward rule, triggered with the predicate of the conclusion (upper formula), from within any other rule needing this knowledge, and completed when the premise is fulfilled.

{
	?personLife time:hasMaxDuration "P125Y"^^xsd:duration. # If another value is wanted, it only has to be changed here.
}
<= # backward rule
{
	?person human:hasLife ?personLife.
}.


# OR a shortcut, but then without knowledge about the life as an event:

# {
#	?person human:hasMaxLifeSpan "P125Y"^^xsd:duration.
# }
# <= # backward rule
# {
#	?person a human:Person.
# }.
