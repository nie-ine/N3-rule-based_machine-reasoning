Basic command example for EYE:

    eye					  # call the machine reasoner  
    					  # one or more options can be used, e.g.  
    --nope				  # option for output without a proof
    --traditional		  # option for N3 syntax, e.g. @prefix instead of PREFIX  
    					  # data references can be added:  
    .../rdf-data.ttl	  # ref. to one or more RDF data sets expressed in Turtle syntax (.ttl, subset of N3); .ttl can be replaced by .n3  
    .../owl-ontology.ttl  # ref. to one or more OWL ontologies expressed in OWL Full or lesser sublanguage, using all possible elements of RDF/S-OWL ontologies  
    .../rule.n3			  # ref. to one or more N3-rules; EYE is a 'stateless' reasoner, meaning that all inferencing formalisms have to be fed to it  
    				      # output as a pass OR an N3-query:  
    --pass				  # output deductive closure: all the stated and inferred triples except the rules  
    --pass-all			  # output deductive closure plus rules  
    --query				  # output filtered with filter rules  
    >				      # output can be written to a file
    .../result.n3		  # result file


Command for the EYE machine reasoner for a cardinality consistency check on a demo data set:

    eye --nope --traditional  
    .../images-demo-data.ttl  # RDF data set about images expressed in Knora Base Ontology and Images Ontology semantics  
    .../knora-base.ttl        # Knora Base Ontology [1] for its class restrictions on properties  
    .../images.ttl			  # Images Ontology [2] for its class restrictions on properties  
    .../rdfs-subClassOf       # N3 rules expressing the RDFS sub-class model theory [3], for restriction check on different levels  
    .../rdfs-subPropertyOf    # N3 rules expressing the RDFS sub-property model theory [4], for restriction check on different levels
    .../cardinality.n3        # N3 rules expressing the OWL cardinality model theory   
    --query
    cardinality-query.n3	  # The cardinality N3 rules have a boolean as conclusion, thus no need for a query or pass, but added here as example
    > .../cardinality-result.n3
